\title{Likelihood ratio test for BayesTraits models.}
\usage{
lr.test(model1, model2)
}
\description{
	Perform likelihood ratio test for output from a pair of BayesTraits maximum likelihood models. 
}
\arguments{
  \item{model1}{output from a maximum likelihood BayesTraits analysis. Can include one or more models, but must have the same number of models as model2.}
  \item{model2}{output from a maximum likelihood BayesTraits analysis. Can include one or more models, but must have the same number of models as model1.}
}
\details{
	If there are multiple models in the BayesTraits output (e.g., models were fit across a sample of phylogenies), then the likelihood ratio test is performed for each pair of models and a separate row of results is generated for each pair.
}
\value{
	Results from likelihood ratio test(s) in a dataframe.
